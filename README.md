# Cybersecurity Portfolio & CTF Write-ups

**Jaren Billups** | *M.S. Cybersecurity Candidate, Mathematician, and Systems Analyst*

Welcome to my technical portfolio. This repository will document my independent learning journey into penetration testing, network forensics, and security research. My end-goal is to showcase my growing skillset by applying theoretical concepts to sandboxed labs, demonstrating how I am teaching myself to both identify vulnerabilities and document the necessary remediation steps through practical application. 

## 🛠️ Technical Focus
* **Offensive Security:** Active Directory Exploitation, Privilege Escalation, Web Application Security (OWASP Top 10).
* **Defensive Operations:** Network Traffic Analysis (Wireshark/Argus), SIEM Log Analysis, Compliance (STIGs).
* **Tools:** Python, PowerShell, Nmap, Burp Suite, Responder, Metasploit.
