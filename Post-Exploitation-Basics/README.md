# Post-Exploitation Basics: Methodologies & Tools

**Platform:** TryHackMe | **Category:** Active Directory / Windows | **Date:** Dec 20, 2025 | **Link:** https://tryhackme.com/room/postexploit |

## 1. Executive Summary
This project explores standard post-compromise methodologies within a Windows Active Directory environment. The objective was to utilize industry-standard tools to enumerate domain users, map attack paths, and extract credentials for privilege escalation.

**Tools Deployed:**
* **PowerView:** PowerShell-based domain enumeration.
* **BloodHound:** Graph theory analysis for attack path visualization.
* **Mimikatz:** Credential dumping and ticket manipulation.
* **Server Manager:** Native Windows administration tools.

## 2. Domain Enumeration (PowerView)
**Objective:** Gain situational awareness of the domain without triggering immediate alerts.

### 2.1 Initialization
I first accessed the target machine via ssh Administrator@$box and used the password that was provided. To run the Powerview script I ran, 
```powershell
powershell -ep bypass
. .\Downloads\PowerView.ps1
```
PowerView.ps1 was alredy pre-downloaded as indicated in the THM room.

### 2.2 User Enumeration
I then enumerated all of the domain users to attempt to identify potential targets for lateral mvemoent. 
```powershell
Get-NetUser | select cn
```
### 2.3 Domain Enumeration
Then enumerated the domain groups:
```powershell
Get-NetGroup -GroupName *admin*
```
### 2.4 Shared Folder Enumeration
```powershell
Invoke-ShareFinder
```
In our output we can see that the folder "Share" was created manually by a user and/or administrator. All of the other folders are native in the standard Windows installation. "Share" was specifically created to share files on the network. 

### 2.5 OS Fingerprinting
I was tasked with finding the operating system running inside of the network that is not Windows Server 2019
```powershell
Get-NetComputer -fulldata | select operatingsystem
```
With the only os running being Windows 10 Enterprise Evaluation

### We were tasked with finding a flag within the enumerated users, as we can one of the users is POST{P0W3RV13W_FTW}
